# Command+Click - The Simplest Way! ⌘+Click

## What Changed

## How to Use

3. **Click** on the selected text
4. **Definition popup appears** instantly!

## Example

| Control+Click | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Context menu | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 3-Finger Tap | ⭐⭐⭐ | macOS Look Up | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Keyboard Shortcut | ⭐⭐ | Siri, etc. | ⭐⭐⭐ |

## Technical Details

- **Activation**: Command key + left mouse button
- **Requires**: Accessibility permissions (already configured)
- **Works in**: All apps that support text selection
- **Delay**: 0.05s after click to ensure text is properly selected

## No More Complex Shortcuts!

Previous versions had multiple activation modes and complex keyboard shortcuts. Now it's just:

**⌘ + Click = Definition**

That's it! Simple, fast, and intuitive.

## Testing

Try these words with Command+Click:

1. `beautiful` - Common word
2. `serendipity` - Complex word  
3. `ephemeral` - Less common word
4. `test` - Simple word

## If It Doesn't Work

1. **Check Preferences**: Menu bar → Preferences
   - Should show "Trigger monitor active" (green)
   
2. **Check Accessibility**: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
   - WordJournal should be enabled ✅
   
3. **Try Test Lookup**: Menu bar → Test Lookup
   - This bypasses Command+Click to test the dictionary

4. **Check Console**: Open Console.app, filter by "TriggerManager"
   - Should see: "✅✅✅ COMMAND+CLICK DETECTED!"

## Perfect for Daily Use

Command+Click is perfect for:
- 📚 Reading articles and looking up unfamiliar words
- ✍️ Writing and checking word meanings
- 📖 Learning new vocabulary
- 🌍 Reading foreign language content (English definitions)

Just select, Command+Click, and learn! 🎉
