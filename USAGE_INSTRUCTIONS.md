# How to Use WordJournal - Command+Click

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The Correct Way

### Step-by-Step:

1. **FIRST: Select the text**
   - Double-click a word to select it
   - Or drag to select text
   - The text should be **highlighted** (blue background)

2. **THEN: Command+Click**
   - Hold the **Command (⌘)** key
   - **Click** anywhere on the selected text
   - The definition popup will appear!

## ❌ Common Mistake

**DON'T DO THIS:**
- Command+Click on unselected text ❌
- This won't work because there's no text selected!

**DO THIS:**
1. **Select first** (double-click) ✅
2. **Then Command+Click** ✅

## 📝 Example Walkthrough

### In TextEdit:

1. Open TextEdit
2. Type: `beautiful`
3. **Double-click** the word (it should turn blue/highlighted)
4. With the word still selected and highlighted:
   - **Hold Command (⌘)**
   - **Click** on the word
5. Popup appears with definition!

## 🎯 Visual Guide

```
Step 1: Type word
beautiful

Step 2: Double-click to select (word turns blue)
[beautiful]  ← highlighted/selected

Step 3: Hold ⌘ and click on the selected text
[beautiful]  ← ⌘+Click here!
     ↑
   Click with Command held

Step 4: Definition popup appears!
```

## 💡 Why Two Steps?

1. **Selection** = Tells the app which word you want to look up
2. **Command+Click** = Triggers the lookup action

The app needs to know what text to look up, so you must select it first!

## 🔄 Quick Workflow

For daily use, this becomes natural:

1. **Double-click** word → It's selected
2. **⌘+Click** on it → See definition
3. Read definition
4. Click "Add to Journal" (optional)

Gets faster with practice!

## ⚡ Pro Tip

Once you select a word (double-click), you can keep Command held and just click on other selected words to look them up quickly!
