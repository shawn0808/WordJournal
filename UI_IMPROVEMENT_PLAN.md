# UI Improvement Plan

## Definition Popup
- [ ] Rounded corners with subtle shadow — modern macOS appearance
- [ ] Better typography — proper font weights, spacing, and hierarchy for word, phonetic, POS, definitions
- [ ] Visual separator between different parts of speech
- [ ] Hover effect on + buttons (color/scale animation)
- [ ] Loading state — show a spinner while fetching definitions

## Journal View
- [ ] Alternating row colors for better readability
- [ ] Empty state — friendly message when journal is empty ("No words yet. Look up a word to get started!")
- [ ] Better toolbar design — more polished buttons with proper spacing
- [ ] Confirmation dialog before deleting an entry

## Menu Bar Dropdown
- [ ] Visual polish — subtle icons, better spacing, word count badge
- [ ] Recent lookups — show last 3-5 words for quick re-access

## General
- [ ] Consistent color scheme — define accent colors across all views
- [ ] Dark mode support — ensure everything looks good in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Smooth animations — fade in popup, animate journal additions
